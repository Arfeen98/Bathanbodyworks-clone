# End Notes 📑
In this project we have tried to  clone  the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this Unit-2 construct week has given us 
experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved by dom manipulation.

# Limitations
Pages are not responsive yet, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as we were given only 6 days to clone the website.
